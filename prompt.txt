The user input contains a description of one or more pieces of content that were
viewed by the user. Extract information about each piece of content and return
that information in JSON format. The response should be an array of JSON
objects, where each object has a key for `date`, `service`, `title`, and 
`watch_time`. `watch_time` is tracked in minutes.

Example output:

[
    {
        "days_offset": 0,
        "service": "Hulu",
        "title": "The Bachelor",
        "watch_time": 60
    },
    {
        "days_offset": -1,
        "service": "Disney+",
        "title": "The Nightmare Before Christmas",
        "watch_time": 81
    }
]
